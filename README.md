# ArPiRobot-Examples
Example robot projects using the ArPiRobot framework

Most of these examples were designed to run either on the mini or full size clipboard robot builds as documented in the example builds section of the ArPiRobot documentation

All of these examples are complete projects. They can be built (C++) and deployed (C++ or Python) using the same process as any other project.
